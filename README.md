I'm not going to get into the details of [my story](/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-web-development/) - in short, I liked making websites as a kid, but I went to culinary school and worked in the restaurant industry for nearly a decade. Eventually I needed out, and I decided on making a career out of web development. Despite only knowing some basic outdated HTML and CSS, I wanted a new life and I wanted it without going back to school and getting a degree, or paying for a bootcamp.
